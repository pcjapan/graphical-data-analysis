# Preparing your data

Set your working directory where you will store the r script and any other files you may need for the project

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/R Worksets/JALT2020 Workshop")
```

Create bimodal distribution data set to illustrate normality assumptions

```{r}
nn <- 100
set.seed(1234)
sim1 <- c(rtruncnorm(nn/2, a=0, b=10, mean=2, sd=.75),
          rtruncnorm(nn/2, a=0, b=10, mean=8, sd=.75))
```

Create a more normally-distributed second sample

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
sim2 <- rnorm(100, mean = 5, sd = .75)

x1 <- as.data.frame(sim1)
x2 <- as.data.frame(sim2)
```

Store the data in a format (dataframe) that can easily be retrieved for the analysis

```{r}
x3 <- as.data.frame(cbind(sim1, sim2)) ## this joins the two data sets together and transforms them into a dataframe
write.csv(x3, "x3_data.csv") ## this command writes the dataframe to a csv file ("x3_data.csv") and saves it on your computer in the working directory
```

You can check there are no problems with the data by using the `head` & `tail` commands which display the first & last few lines respectively of the data:
  
```{r}
head(x3); tail(x3)
```

## Histograms to show data distribution.

Using the `hist` command which is part of the base installation of R. Work with the `sim1` & `sim2` samples from above. 

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
hist(sim1, prob=F, main = "", xlab = "Group 1", xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(0,20), breaks=15, cex.main=1.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)
abline(v=mean(sim1),col="blue", lty = 2)

hist(sim2, prob=F, main = "", xlab = "Group 2", xlim = c(0,10), breaks=15, cex.main=1.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5)
abline(v=mean(sim1),col="blue", lty = 2)
```

## QQ Plots.

Using the `qqnorm` command which is part of the base R installation. Work with the `sim1` & `sim2` samples from above.

```{r}
qqnorm(sim1, cex.main=1.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5, main = "Group 1")	# this produces the graph
qqline(sim1) # this adds a line showing a theoretical normal distribution for comparison

qqnorm(sim2, cex.main=1.5, cex.lab=1.5, cex.axis=1.5,  main = "Group 2")	# this produces the graph
qqline(sim2)  # this adds a line showing a theoretical normal distribution for comparison
```

# Boxplots and variants for comparisions

**Boxplots** are good for showing the difference between two (or more) samples, e.g. when you would do a t-test or an ANOVA (or a non-parametric equivalent). 

* To create a basic boxplot using base R installation commands:
  
```{r  fig.height=5, fig.width=12}
boxplot(sim2, col = "white", ann = F, horizontal = T, ylim = c(3,7))
#using dataset sim2, no annotations on the axes, y axis range is from 3 to 7
```


## Boxplots for simulated data set 1.

These are created using the ggplot2 package. This can be installed and activated as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

The code to generate the boxplot is more complex here. The first three lines of code create the plot; the following code handles the appearance of the plot. In this case we're creating two plots, fig5a & fig5b.


```{r}
fig5a <- ggplot(x1) +
  aes(x = "", y = sim1) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  # These commands control the appearance of aspects of the theme
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  ylim(0, 10) +
  labs(x = "Group 1", y = "Comprehension Score")

fig5b <- ggplot(x2) +
  aes(x = "", y = sim2) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal()  +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  ylim(0, 10) +
  labs(x = "Group 2", y = "")
```

Load the `cowplot` package. This lets you plot different graphs on the same grid...

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("cowplot")
library(cowplot)
```

...using the `plot_grid` command from `cowplot`

```{r}
plot_grid(fig5a, fig5b)
```



## Boxplots for simulated data set 1 augmented with jittered data.

Here we add the data points to the boxplot. This involves just one extra line of code:


```{r fig.cap = "Figure 6"}
fig6a <- ggplot(x1) +
  aes(x = "", y = sim1) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  # This additional line of code adds the data points
  geom_jitter(width = .2, size = 3, colour = "orange") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  ylim(0, 10) +
  labs(x = "Group 1", y = "Comprehension Score")

fig6b <- ggplot(x2) +
  aes(x = "", y = sim2) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
  geom_jitter(width = .2, size = 3, colour = "blue") +
  theme_minimal()  +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14), 
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14,)) +
  ylim(0, 10) +
  labs(x = "Group 2", y = "")
plot_grid(fig6a, fig6b)
```

## Dotplot for simulated data set 1.

An alternative way to display the data is as a dotplot

```{r}
fig7a <- ggplot(x1) + 
  aes(x = "", y = sim1, fill = "sim1") +
  # main changes are as follows
  stat_summary(fun = median, fun.min = median, fun.max = median, geom = "crossbar", width = 0.6, size = 0.4, color = "black", alpha = 0.6) + # generate the bar showing the median score
  geom_dotplot(binaxis ="y", binwidth = 0.2, stackdir = "center", stackratio = 1.5) + # plot the data as individual points 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  ylim(0, 10) +
  labs(x = "Group 1", y = "Comprehension Score")

fig7b <- ggplot(x2) + 
  aes(x = "", y = sim2, fill = "sim1") +
  stat_summary(fun = median, fun.min = median, fun.max = median, geom = "crossbar", width = 0.6, size = 0.4, color = "black", alpha = 0.6) + # generate the bar showing the median score
  geom_dotplot(binaxis ="y", binwidth = 0.2, stackdir = "center", stackratio = 1.5) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=14), 
        axis.text.y = element_blank(), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  ylim(0, 10) +
  labs(x = "Group 2", y = "")

plot_grid(fig7a, fig7b)
```

## Violin plots for simulated data set 1.

Violin plots show how the data is distributed and as such are helpful for understanding the structure of your dataset. 

```{r}
fig8a <- ggplot(x1) +
  aes(x = "", y = sim1) +
  # This is the only change from figure 5, calling for a violin plot rather than a boxplot.
  # The adjust and scale arguments set the size of the plots.
  geom_violin(adjust = 1L, scale = "count") + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  ylim(0, 10) +
  labs(x = "Group 1", y = "Comprehension Score")

fig8b <- ggplot(x2) +
  aes(x = "", y = sim2) +
  geom_violin(adjust = 1L, scale = "area") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  ylim(0, 10) +
  labs(x = "Group 2", y = "")

plot_grid(fig8a, fig8b)
```

## Notched boxplots

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
response = rnorm(n = 80, mean = c(74, 70), sd = c(3, 4.5))
group = rep(letters[1:2], length.out = 80)
sim4 <- data.frame(group,
                   response)

ggplot(sim4) +
  aes(x = group, y = response) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE, notchwidth = 0.75) +
  theme_minimal()  +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14), # These commands control aspects of the theme, in this case the axis text
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) +
  ylim(55, 85) +
  labs(x = "Groups", y = "")
```

# Scatterplots - Looking at Relationships

## Anscombe’s scatterplots.
(Code taken from the _dataset_ package - see https://rdrr.io/r/datasets/anscombe.html)

```{r}
anscombe
summary(anscombe)
ff <- y ~ x
mods <- setNames(as.list(1:4), paste0("lm", 1:4))
for(i in 1:4) {
  ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
  ## or   ff[[2]] <- as.name(paste0("y", i))
  ##      ff[[3]] <- as.name(paste0("x", i))
  mods[[i]] <- lmi <- lm(ff, data = anscombe)
  print(anova(lmi))
}

sapply(mods, coef)
lapply(mods, function(fm) coef(summary(fm)))


op <- par(mfrow = c(2, 2), mar = 0.1+c(4,4,1,1), oma =  c(0, 0, 2, 0))
for(i in 1:4) {
  ff[2:3] <- lapply(paste0(c("y","x"), i), as.name)
  plot(ff, data = anscombe, col = "red", pch = 21, bg = "orange", cex = 1.2,
       xlim = c(3, 19), ylim = c(3, 13))
  abline(mods[[i]], col = "blue")
}
mtext("Anscombe's 4 Regression data sets", outer = TRUE, cex = 1.5)
par(op)

lmi
summary(lm(y1 ~ x1, dat = anscombe))
summary(lm(y2 ~ x2, dat = anscombe))
summary(lm(y3 ~ x3, dat = anscombe))
```

## Scatterplot with loess and regression lines for simulated dataset 3.

First, genrate dataset to use

```{r}
sim5 <- data.frame(Subject = (1:30),
                   Group = rep(c("A","B")),
                  x = c(1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,8,8,8,9,9),
                  y = c(6,3,5,1,9,4,6,2,11,4,12,7,13,6,10,6,18,4,17,7,16,7,10,6,14,5,15,9,16,12))

group_names <- c(
  A = "Group A",
  B = "Group B"
)
```
Next, generate the plot. This includes a regression line (dotted blue line) with confidence interval band, and a loess line (the curved line). 

```{r}
ggplot(sim5) +
  aes(x = x, y = y) +
  geom_point(size = 3, aes(shape = Group, colour = Group), alpha = .8) +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.75, se = F, aes(colour = Group, linetype = "dashed")) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", aes(fill = Group, linetype = "dotted"), alpha = 0.1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_colour_viridis_d(begin = .3, end = .7) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = "C", begin = .2, end = .8) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size=14),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"),
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14)) + 
  scale_linetype_discrete(guide = FALSE) 
```

## Unpaired estimation plot (2 sample).

An alternative to carrying out statistical significance tests. 
First, transfer the data set to the correct format

```{r}
sim5.long <- reshape2::melt(sim5, id = c("Subject", "Group"), measured = c("x", "y"))
```

```{r}
fig12 <- dabest(sim5.long, variable, value,
                             idx = c("x", "y"),
                             paired = FALSE) %>% 
  cohens_d()

fig12

plot(fig12, color.column = Group, rawplot.ylabel = "Group Scores", effsize.ylabel = "Effect Size (Cohens d) and 95% CI (5,000 bootstrap resamples)")
```

## Paired estimation plot (2 sample).

```{r}
fig13 <- dabest(sim5.long, variable, value,
                           idx = c("x", "y"),
                           paired = TRUE, id.col = Subject)
fig13.effect <- cohens_d(fig13)  


plot(fig13.effect, color.column = Group, rawplot.ylabel = "Group Scores", effsize.ylabel = "Effect Size (Cohens d) and 95% CI (5,000 bootstrap resamples)")

```



## NOTE

The following section will be completed soon.

# Additional Graphics

The following was not included in the original paper due to word count limitations. It is presented here as a supplement.

* the data we will work with here is available on my Github repository https://github.com/pcjapan/graphical-data-analysis. The first data set is called comprehension-data.txt. Save a copy of the data in your working directory, and then read into R: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
working <- read.delim("path_to_file/comprehension-data.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")
```

* To work with the `ggplot2` library, and many other functions in R, your data has to be in `long` format, as opposed to `wide`
* `Wide` format is where each individual subject is recorded as a unique row of your excel/csv file, with a column for every measured variable related to that subject, `Long` format has every row containing a measure for a particular variable for each subject. In `wide` data the subjects will not be repeated in rows. In `long` data, the subject may be listed in multiple rows as the data is grouped by the subject response to each variable under study.
* It's fairly easy to change the format of your data in R. One way is by using the `melt` function in the `reshape2` library (this is part of the R base installation):

```{r}
require(reshape2)
```

* then run the necessary code. Remember, we're working with data that has been loaded into the "working" dataframe, and we will save the transformed data into a new dataframe named "longComp".


```{r}
longComp <- melt(working, id = c("ID", "Class"), measured = c("Pretest", "Posttest"))
names(longComp) <- c("Student", "Class", "Test", "Comprehension")
```

To see the difference in the data, look at the first few rows.

Here, we have a pretest and posttest score for each student from separate classes on a comprehension test. Scores are entered as one row for each student.

```{r}
head(working) ## Original data
tail(working)
```

Now the data has been rearranged to list in each row the comprehension score for each student by the kind of test. 

```{r}
head(longComp) ## New data
tail(longComp)
```

For any research project, first check your data to see how it is distributed

* Check data for normality - generate a qqplot

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=8}
qqnorm(working$Pretest, pch = 1, frame = FALSE)
qqline(working$Pretest, col = "steelblue", lwd = 2)
```

* Or look at a histogram of the distribution.

Here, think about what you are expecting to see in the data. A skewed distribution may be what your theory predicts, so may not be a problem; however, it raises issues for the kinds of statistical tests you can carry out.

```{r}
ggplot(working, aes(x=Pretest)) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(y=..density..), colour="gray", fill="white", binwidth = .3)+
  geom_density(color = "red", alpha=.2, fill="#FF6666") 
```


**Line graphs** can show changes in trends in a dataset, but are limited in the information they show. Augmenting with confidence interval bars makes them slightly more informative. Here, we use the `facet_grid` function in `ggplot2` to plot the three graphs on individual panels and display them side-by-side, rather than having them all plotted on the same panel which would reduce readability.  

```{r fig.height=5, fig.width=10}
line <- ggplot(longComp, aes(Test, Comprehension, color = Class))
line + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point") + 
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "line", aes(group = Class)) +
  theme_minimal() + 
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_boot, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.2) + ## Add confidence interval (CI) error bars
  facet_grid(.~Class)
```

## Theming graphs

Here is where the power of `ggplot` comes into play. You can create a more attractive version of the above or modify most aspects of the display by setting various paramater

* If you haven't already done so, install (you only need to do this the first time you use it) and load the current version of the ggplot library, `ggplot2`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages(ggplot2)
```

* Then load the package into R. You need to do this with all packages you wish to use:

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2) #load and activate the package
```

* Generate the graph, here we're making a boxplot:

```{r}
boxplot <- ggplot(longComp, aes(Class, Comprehension)) #this creates the base graph

CompBox <- boxplot +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, aes(fill = Class)) +  # adding layers to the graph - this sets up the boxplot, using the "Class" condition to identify the data 
  labs(x = "Class", y = "Mean Comprehension Score") + # add labels to the x & y axes
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(size=14), # These commands control the appearance of aspects of the theme
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "snow1")) + 
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, alpha=0.6) + # Use the viridis colour palettes for colour choices - improves readability
  ggtitle("Changes in Comprehension Scores") + # add a title
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1)) + # set the y-axis scale
  facet_wrap(~Test) # this creates a panelled view where the graphs are displayed in separate panels based on the "Test" condition

CompBox  +
  geom_jitter(color="black", size=2, alpha=0.6, width = 0.1) #here you are adding the data points to the graph
```

**Violin plots**  To get a violin plot, just change a couple of lines in the code above:

```{r}
violinplot <- boxplot +
  geom_violin(scale = "count", aes(fill = Class)) + # adding the plot layer to the graph - "count" means areas are scaled proportionally to the number of observations
  geom_boxplot(width=0.1, color="grey60", alpha=0.8, ) + # optionally adding boxplots to provide another layer of detail
  labs(x = "Class", y = "Mean Comprehension Score") + 
  theme(legend.position = "none", axis.text.x = element_text(size=14), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 16, lineheight = 2),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, lineheight = 2, face="bold"), 
        strip.text.x = element_text(size = 14), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "snow1")) + 
  viridis::scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, alpha=0.6) +
  ggtitle("Changes in Comprehension Scores") + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,1)) + 
  facet_wrap(~Test) 

violinplot
```
